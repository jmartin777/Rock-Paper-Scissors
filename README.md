# Rock-Paper-Scissors

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I've built a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a computer player. The game features two difficulty modes, Classic and Future, and allows players to choose between Rock, Paper, Scissors, Boom and Hand. The game keeps track of the wins of both players then displays the results on the screen.The game also allows players to restart the game after each round. The problem to solve for this app was providing an interactive and entertaining way to play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The application implements a computer player, different difficulty modes and a clean and easy to use interface, making the user- expierience fluid and easy.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

Open up the terminal and paste the SSH code after typing git clone in the terminal. Next enter the repesitory with the cd command. Then type code . and the code will come up in the text editer. Then in the terminal type open index.html and the application will open in the browser.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

Using Javascript functionality which simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors. The game allows users to select the game mode by clicking on either the "Classic Mode" button or the "Future Mode" button. The game also allows players to select a move by clicking on either a rock, paper or scissors (hand, boom in "Future Mode") image. The code uses the JavaScript class constructors as a data model, which creates an object and adds functionality for the game and for the players. The class constructors are responsible for the methods of determining the winner of the game and displaying the results.Using JavaScript event listeners adds interactivity to the game from a user-face standpoint, such as allowing users to select game modes and making moves. The code uses CSS/Flexbox to style and organize the game interface . I would say I started working on the evening of Jan 11th and finished Jan 16th (the project start/end date was Jan 10th - Jan 17th). I am currently at the end of my Mod-1 expierince and elevating to Mod-2 in two weeks!

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The main learning goals of this project for me was to understand how to create a game using JavaScript. I felt it was a way for us to handle user interaction with a randomzied response system that triggers logic from event listeners. Which process and update the UI using DOM manipulation from Javascript. The code is written in JavaScript which uses classes and objects to input the game logic. Event listeners to shapes user interaction and DOM manipulation to reveal elements on a webpage. The application uses HTML, CSS/Flex to design and organize the layout/style of the webpage.
